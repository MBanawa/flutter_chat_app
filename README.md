# flutter_chat_app

A mondern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat

## My Goal

The objective of this project is to learn how to incorporate Firebase into a simple chat app. I used Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip the app with a cloud based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods. I also added a few animations in the welcome screen.
